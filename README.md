#appleBrightnessModifier
A straightforward script for incrementing or decrementing the value at
/sys/class/backlight/apple_backlight/brightness via command line. This
is the script I use in my install of #! (a Debian based distro) after
changing to the awesome window manager, which did not bind any keys to
brightness modification in stock set up.
